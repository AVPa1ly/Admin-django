# Project info

This project contains admin page, generated via django framework. It works directly with PostgreeSQL and can be used by comany employees to perform CRUD operations over entities.

## Role separation support includes:

- Admin, capable of user editing;
- Content maker, whose mission is editing news and special offers;
- Flight worker, who is able to update flight data and set up prizes for "Fortune wheel" module.

The app uses pretty much default layout and has reduced functionality compared to initial Technical task, as the main user functionality is performed via Mobile application.

## A short example of admin pannel over deployed server:
